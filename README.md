SUMMARY:

In this assignment we were tasked with pulling data from the OpenWeather API, and then taking that data and dynamically generating it on the page. We did this so that the user can search for city, and see both the current forecast and the five day forecast. 

Technologies Used:
OpenWeather API to pull weather data
moment.js npm library for date conversion
jquery to target elements in our HTML
bootstrap to create our HTML page

USER STORY
